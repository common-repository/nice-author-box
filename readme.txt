<h3>Features:</h3>
Nice Author Box is a feature-rich plugin. It allows you to add a custom title and a color border to the author box and enables you to change the background color and title/description font size of the author box. The plugin lets you link the title with the author's URL. You can configure the plugin to open this URL in a new tab or in the same tab or display the author box above or below the post content. The plugin also provides an option to show the user's gravatar at the right or left side of the author box.
